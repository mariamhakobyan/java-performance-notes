======================

### Chapter 1: Introduction


* A good algorithm is the most important thing when it comes to fast performance.
* Write less code
* Every line of code involves a choice, and if there is a choice between two simple, straightforward ways of programming, choose the more performant one.
* Bugs and Performance Issues Arenâ€™t Limited to the JVM
* Ockham's razor is a principle from philosophy. 
  * Suppose there exist two explanations for an occurrence. In this case the simpler one is usually better. 
  * Another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation is.
   
### Chapter 2: An Approach to Performance Testing

* Test a Real Application
  * The first principle is that testing should occur on the actual product in the way the product will be used.
