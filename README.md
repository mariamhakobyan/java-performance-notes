======================

### Chapter 1: Introduction


* A good algorithm is the most important thing when it comes to fast performance.
* Write less code
* Every line of code involves a choice, and if there is a choice between two simple, straightforward ways of programming, choose the more performant one.
* Bugs and Performance Issues Aren’t Limited to the JVM
* Ockham's razor is a principle from philosophy. 
  * Suppose there exist two explanations for an occurrence. In this case the simpler one is usually better. 
  * Another way of saying it is that the more assumptions you have to make, the more unlikely an explanation is.
   
### Chapter 2: An Approach to Performance Testing

#### Four Principles of Performance Testing

* Test a Real Application
  * The first principle is that testing should occur on the actual product in the way the product will be used.
  

#### Three types of Performance Testing

* Microbenchmarks
  * A microbenchmark is a test designed to measure a very small unit of performance. 
    * e.g. the time to call a synchronized method versus a nonsynchronized method
  * Microbenchmarks may seem like a good idea, but they are very difficult to write cor‐ rectly.
* Macrobenchmarks
* Mesobenchmarks
